# Gmail to Amazon SES Relay

**What is this?**

This is a simple application to grab an email from you gmail inbox, edit it, then send it to the Amazon Simple Email Service for mass distribution.

**How does it work?**

Couldn't be easier! All that is needed is an gmail application access key and an amazon ses key. Once you have them, you can read from your gmail inbox, edit an email and send it off to a client list.

    "auth_uri":"https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth",

    "client_secret":"YOUR_SECRET",
    "redirect_uris":["http://localhost"]}
}
```

## Example of aws_credentials.csv

This should be automatically generated by AWS SES portal. Just download it.
This is an example of what it should look like.

```
